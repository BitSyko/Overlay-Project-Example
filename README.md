#Overlay Project Example

#####Welcome, this is an example project for android studio which can be used as a base for building layers Overlays.
This project is a little bit enhanced to be better compatible to the Layers plugin for Layers manager (https://github.com/BitSyko/LayersThemePlugin_Example) which can be used for publishing your theme on the playStore.
  - No need to edit the Manifest file, all relevant things are inside the build.gradle file
  - Automatic applicationId naming like : Overlay.ThemeName.OverlayedApp
  - Automatic Overlay apk file naming like: ThemeName.OverlayedApp.apk
  - Save all Overlays in specific Folder
  - Group Overlays of specific categories (used in Layers Manager Plugin)
